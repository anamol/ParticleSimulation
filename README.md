Particle Collision Simulator
===================

This is a work in progress.

This is the readme file for the Particle Simulation software. We are trying to simulate a lot of particles
moving around in a domain. The goal is to completely model any kind of particle interaction, the motivation
being soot particle formation and growth in flames. This would include accurately modeling collisions,
coagulation, aggregation, surface growth and oxidation of particles.
